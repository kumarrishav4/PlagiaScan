# PlagiaScan

PlagiaScan is a powerful plagiarism detection software implemented in Python, designed to deliver exceptional performance and precision. 
Unlike conventional plagiarism checkers, PlagiaScan is capable of recognizing not only human-generated content but also content generated by artificial intelligence.
## STATUS : Incomplete
## Features

- **High Performance**: PlagiaScan is optimized for speed and efficiency, capable of processing large volumes of text and code swiftly.
  
- **Precision**: With advanced algorithms and techniques, PlagiaScan provides accurate detection of plagiarized content, ensuring reliable results.

- **Support for AI-generated Content**: PlagiaScan goes beyond traditional plagiarism detection by effectively identifying content generated by artificial intelligence models.

- **Customization**: PlagiaScan offers flexibility with customizable parameters and settings to tailor the plagiarism detection process according to specific requirements.

## Plagiarism Detection Methods

PlagiaScan employs various methods to identify plagiarism:

1. **Token-Based Similarity**:
   - Treats code as a sequence of tokens (keywords, identifiers, literals, etc.) and calculates similarity based on token sequences.

2. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Comparison**:
   - Represents code as a tree structure capturing the syntactic relationships between elements, and compares ASTs to detect similarities.

3. **Function/Method Mapping**:
   - Identifies similar functions or methods across codebases by analyzing their signatures, names, and behaviors.

4. **Clone Detection Algorithms**:
   - Detects code clones, which are identical or near-identical code fragments, using techniques like token-based hashing and tree-based clone detection.

5. **Shingling**:
   - Breaks documents into overlapping sequences of words (shingles) and compares them to detect similarities.

6. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - Analyzes the semantic meaning of code by considering variable names, comments, and overall logic to detect plagiarism.
